# PlanetKubb_v0.8
Kubb Canada's application to utilize the Planet Kubb scoring system.

This project was originally created as a learning tool.  I had no prior knowledge of the Android programming environment
and very little Java experience.  Hence, the code within here is quite spaghetti like.  I did not comment my code well but 
will be going back over it with more comments in the near future.

The current test version of the APK can be found <a href="https://github.com/kubbcanada/PlanetKubb_v0.8/blob/master/PlanetKubb/PlanetKubb.apk?raw=true">here</a>
